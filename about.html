      <p>I am new to programming but have decades of applicable experience in life. Living all over the country and working in different industries has meant applying knowledge across situations for problem solving and doing my best to set myself and those around me up for success. I have always been able to learn quickly, especially in matters of processes and task completion.</p>

      <p>Working my way to management within most organizations I join, I have a breadth of knowledge from entry level all the way to upper management as well as insights on corporate leadership. This allows me to be empathetic; as an employee, of my management as I am aware of the pressure they are under. Being able to review things with a manager’s eye provides an advantage of spotting out of place resources while being versed in high overview Vice President and C-level statistical analysis allows me to better stay ahead of expectations for stakeholders.</p> 

      <p>I offer dedication to growth, efficiency and leading by example as if my livelihood depends on it. Because it does.</p>

      <p>I have lived in big cities, small towns and even a cluster of cities; The Seven Cities? Hampton Roads? No? Forget it, the point is, having been to these places has given me a spectrum of how people live and work. I like the idea of city living and being able to walk everywhere and barely drive, but I also like the small towns that are quiet and clean and steps away from empty space and nature. I love the idea of working somewhere beautiful, not just an office in a nice city. But in a forest, or on a mountain top, or a river bank while I catch dinner for my wife and I. That’s what I want life to be like. I don’t want to “keep up with” anyone. I just want to be.</p>
